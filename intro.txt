<p>The GPA calculation is just an <strong>estimate</strong>. It does NOT represent your official grades. Please talk to your advisor if you are unsure how to use it or have any questions. If your GPA calculation is at a critical point (such as those students on AIP status), talk to your advisor. This calculator does not round up. If the calculation of your GPA is a 2.897, it will not round up to a 2.90 when using it. Your academic standing is based on your Georgia State grades only and not combined with your transfer credit GPA. You can find your GPA information on your <a href="http://www.gosolar.gsu.edu">GoSOLAR</a> account under &#8220;My Grade Point Averages&#8221;.</p>
